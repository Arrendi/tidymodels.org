title: Functions
---

For convenience, here are some searchable lists that might help you explore these packages: 

* [A list of _all_ functions in the tidymodels packages](./all)

* [All models wrapped by the `parsnip` package](./parsnip)

* [Recipe steps across packages](./recipes)

Many of the packages in the tidymodels organization are inter-connected. For example, the `dials` package is focused on creating and managing tuning parameters and is mostly in service to the `tune` package. Also, the `parsnip` and `recipes` packages had "add-on" packages that expand their functionality.
