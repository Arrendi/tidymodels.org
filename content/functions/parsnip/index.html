<p><code>parsnip</code> contains wrappers for a number of models. For example, the <code>parsnip</code> function <code>rand_forest()</code> can be used to create a random forest model. The <strong>mode</strong> of a model is related to its goal. Examples would be regression and classification.</p>
<p>Since there are many models available in R, there are also “side packages” that wrap groups of models:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tidymodels/discrim"><code>discrim</code></a> contains discriminant analysis models.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How</em> the model is created is related to the <strong>engine</strong>. In many cases, this is an R modeling package. In others, it may be a connection to an external system (such as Spark or Tensorflow). The tables below list the engines for each model type.</p>
<p>Models can be added by the user too. See the <a href="https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/articles/articles/Scratch.html">“Making a {parsnip} model from scratch” vignette</a>.</p>
<p>Tidymodels use standardized parameter names to have some consistency between models and engines. The mapping between the <code>parsnip</code> arguments and their original names is:</p>
