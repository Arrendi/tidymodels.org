title: How to contribute to tidymodels
---

The ecosystem of tidymodels packages would not be possible without the contributions of the R community. No matter your current skills, it's possible to contribute back to tidymodels. Contributions are guided by our design goals.

## Design goals

The goals of tidymodels packages are to:

 * Encourage empirical validation and good statistical practice.

 * Smooth out heterogeneous interfaces.
 
 * Establish highly reusable infrastructure.

 * Enable a wider variety of methodologies.

 * Help package developers quickly build high quality model packages of their own.

These package are guided by our [principles for creating modeling packages](https://tidymodels.github.io/model-implementation-principles/).
