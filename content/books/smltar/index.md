Modeling as a statistical practice can encompass a wide variety of activities. This book focuses on supervised or predictive modeling for text, using text data to make predictions about the world around us. We use the tidymodels framework for modeling, a consistent and flexible collection of R packages developed to encourage good statistical practice.

[Silge and Robinson (2017)](https://www.tidymodels.org/books/tidytext/) provides a practical introduction to text mining with R using tidy data principles, based on the tidytext package. If you have already started on the path of gaining insight from your text data, a next step is using that text directly in predictive modeling. Text data contains within it latent information that can be used for insight, understanding, and better decision-making, and predictive modeling with text can bring that information and insight to light. If you have already explored how to analyze text as demonstrated in [Silge and Robinson (2017)](https://www.tidymodels.org/books/tidytext/), this book will move one step further to show you how to learn and make predictions from that text data with supervised models. If you are unfamiliar with this previous work, this book will still provide a robust introduction to how text can be represented in useful ways for modeling and a diverse set of supervised modeling approaches for text.
