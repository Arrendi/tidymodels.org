title: A Compendium of tidymodels Functions
---

Many of the package in the tidymodels organization are inter-connected. For example, the `dials` package is focused on creating and managing tuning parameters and is mostly in service to the `tune` package. Also, the `parsnip` and `recipes` packages had "add-on" packages that expand their functionality. 

For convenience, here are some searchable lists that might help you explore these packages: 

* [A list of _all_ functions in the tidymodels packages](./Functions)

* [All models wrapped by the `parsnip` package](./Parsnip)

* [Recipe steps across packages](./Recipes)
